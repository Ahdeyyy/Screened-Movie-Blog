          Bandit tells the incredible true story of a clever bank robber that
          confounded Canadian authorities for years. Josh Duhamel gives his
          career-best performance as the wily Gilbert Galvan Jr. He's
          infectiously charming as a criminal who used disguises, distractions,
          and methodical planning to pull off, drum roll please, fifty-nine
          heists. Good supporting performances from Elisha Cuthbert, Mel Gibson,
          and Nestor Carbonell complete a winning ensemble. Bandit is told with
          a lighthearted delivery filled with good humor. You root for the
          dashing thief, who used the alias Robert Whiteman, to make another
          glorious escape.

          The film opens on June 12, 1988, in London, Canada. Robert Whiteman
          (Duhamel) enters a bank dressed in a cap, red jacket, and prosthetic
          nose. He cheerily asks the teller to fill his bag with money. Whiteman
          saunters outside in a business suit and briefcase. He tosses a wad of
          cash at a woman with a "For Sale" sign on her car. Whiteman drives
          away laughing as a furious Detective John Snyde (Carbonell) and his
          task force grab a confused patsy paid to dress in the robber's outfit.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whiteman narrates his story throughout the film. In 1984 Detroit,
          Michigan, Gilbert Galvan Jr. is arrested for robbery and fraud. Galvan
          knows he'll get minimum time in a cupcake prison. Galvan easily
          escapes and makes his way north into Canada. He ends up in Ottawa
          selling popsicles from a cart. Galvan gets the job as Robert Whiteman
          after buying a homeless man's license. Whiteman takes shelter at a
          local church. He's smitten by the beautiful and kind Andrea Hudson
          (Cuthbert). Whiteman notices that Canadian banks don't have armed
          guards. He decides to surveil banks in other cities to avoid local
          heat. A stop at a costume store leads to another epiphany. Meanwhile,
          Snyde has failed for years to collar Ottawa's biggest fence and
          gangster, Tommy K (Mel Gibson). A chance drink at Tommy's strip club
          gives Whiteman another idea. He needs a connected partner to fund his
          travels and help him launder the spoils.

        <p>
          Based on The Flying Bandit by Robert Knuckle, Whiteman, known by that
          name to Andrea, Tommy, and the cops, had a likable personality. He
          wasn't a violent man but loved the thrill of robbery. Whiteman enjoyed
          the meticulous planning and disguises. He was always a step ahead of
          Canadian law enforcement. They had no idea that the same man was
          flying all over the country robbing banks. I laughed hysterically as
          Whiteman achieved elite flyer status by racking up airline miles.
        </p>

        <p>
          Director Allan Ungar, known for his popular Uncharted Live Action Fan
          Film, literally uses bells and whistles to sweeten the narrative.
          Sound effects ding as screen captions note the dates, cities, and
          particularly outrageous Whiteman stunts. The guy was an unabashed
          felon but had panache. His earlier robberies are hilarious as he hones
          his skills through trial and error.
        </p>

        <p>
          Duhamel portrays Whiteman as flawed, but sophisticated and
          compassionate. A product of a rough childhood, he never had love or
          belonging as Galvan Jr. His exploits in Canada led to true affection
          for Andrea and his first friend in Tommy. The handsome Duhamel shows
          comedic talent in the bank robberies, then flips effortlessly into a
          committed partner who treasured his new family and surroundings.
          Whiteman finds belonging and happiness but couldn't walk away from
          larcenous urges. Gibson's Tommy has a great line that always rings
          true, "You can only tickle the balls of a lion for so long without
          getting mauled."

          Bandit is produced by Goldrush Entertainment and Yale Productions. It
          will have a theatrical release on September 23rd from Redbox
          Entertainment and Quiver Distribution.
